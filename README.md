# CP/DSA Question Solver

## INTRODUCTION

The CP/DSA Question Solver is a tool designed to assist competitive programmers and students learning data structures and algorithms. It aims to provide solutions to common CP/DSA problems, helping users understand and implement various algorithms and data structures effectively.

## PURPOSE

The purpose of this tool is to:

1.Provide solutions to a wide range of competitive programming and DSA problems.

2.Serve as a learning aid for students and enthusiasts to understand different algorithms and data structures.

3.Help users practice and improve their problem-solving skills.

## FEATURES

1 .Comprehensive Solutions: Covers a variety of problems from basic to advanced levels.
Algorithm Explanations: Includes detailed explanations of the algorithms used.
Code Examples: Provides code implementations in popular programming languages.

2 .Interactive: Allows users to input their own problem statements and get solutions.

3 .Question Processing Pipeline: We process the input questions through web scraping, followed by prompt engineering using PHI-3. The enhanced prompt is then given to the model to generate solution according to the input, and based on that, we make recommendations. Additionally, we have a login system where user-wise data is stored
